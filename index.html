          <h2>About Me.</h2>
          <p>I am a 20 year old, ex-Digital Media Student, and current Epicodus student following the PHP/Drupal tract for back-end development.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Education and experience</h3>
        <p>My education history includes two years at College of the Redwoods in Eureka, California, and <strong>years</strong> of personal experience as a tech enthusiest.</p>
        <div class="panel panel-info">
          <div class="panel-heading">
            <h3 class="panel-title">College experience</h3>
          </div>
          <p>I attended College of the Redwoods for two years. I was studying for an associates degree in Digital Media, specializing in Animation. During my time at College of the Redwoods I learned various things which are relevant to my future career in front and back-end development.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Web Design Principles</li>
              <li>2D, hand-drawn animation</li>
              <li>3D modeling and animation</li>
              <li>Web development with HTML and CSS</li>
              <li>Photo and vector editing skills</li>
              <li>Video editing skills</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>While at college I learned various things and neared the completion of my degree, however I never completed it due to a scheduling error which would result in a year gap before I could take my final required classes. This, combined with a desire to move on from the college experience, caused me to be open to other options, like code bootcamps.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Current Education at Epicodus</h4>
        <p>I heard about Epicodus from a friend who knew that I was interested in technology and coding, who told me about a friend who had great success going through Epicodus and subsequently finding a job after.</p>
        <p>Epicodus interested me because I saw it as an experience that would be equal parts different and effective when compared to college. It was fatigue that first from college that first led me to seek out Epicodus, but it was the data surrounding Epicodus that led me to apply.</p>
        <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have many diverse interests which go <em>beyond</em> the scope of just technology and code.</p>
